## 📊 **Monitoring & Alerting**

### **Grafana Panels**
1. **VRAM Usage %** - Real-time GPU memory
2. **Router P95 Latency** - Response time SLA
3. **CUDA Fragmentation** - Memory fragmentation events  
4. **Daily Cloud Cost** - Budget tracking
5. **LoRA Training Status** - Training pipeline health
6. **System Health** - Service availability

### **Alert Rules**
| Alert | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| HighVRAM | >90% | Page immediately |
| RouterLatencyP95 | >500ms | Page, check fragmentation |
| CUDAFragmentation | >0 events/hr | Warning, schedule reload |
| CloudBudgetExceeded | >$10/day | Critical, check autoscaling |
| LoRATrainingFailure | >2 failures/6hr | Warning, check logs |
| SandboxExecutionFailures | >5%/10min | Warning, check firejail |

## 🔄 **Automation Workflows**

### **Nightly LoRA Training (02:00)**
1. Collect yesterday's misses by head (math, logic, code, reasoning)
2. Prepare training datasets in LoRA format
3. Train adapters with budget limit ($0.20)
4. Evaluate on validation set
5. Deploy if improvement ≥ 2% and cost < budget
6. Update baselines and backup old adapters

### **Data Crawler (02:15)**
1. Crawl 5-10 high-quality challenges from:
   - LeetCode (30% weight)
   - Project Euler (20% weight)
   - Kaggle (20% weight)
   - ArXiv papers (15% weight)
   - GitHub issues (15% weight)
2. Filter by quality score ≥ 0.8
3. Feed to training queue
4. Save to datasets for future use

### **Blind Evaluation (03:00)**
1. Run 100 unseen problems against current model
2. Score responses (exact match + semantic similarity + correctness)
3. Compare against baseline for regression detection
4. Generate report and alert if accuracy drops >5%

make circuit-breaker               # Activate protection
```

**Training Failures**
```bash
docker-compose logs trainer        # Check trainer logs
ls -la training/lora_jobs/         # Check training outputs
make system-profile                # Update hardware profile
```

**Budget Exceeded**
```bash
make budget-check                  # Check current spend

```

### **Emergency Contacts**
