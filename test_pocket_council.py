"""
🎭 Pocket-Council Test Suite
============================

Tests the ultra-low cost Council system with:
- Local triage with confidence scoring
- Multiplex cloud calls
- Scratchpad context boosting
- Cost optimization (target: $0.015-0.03 per deliberation)

Expected outcomes:
✅ 70-80% queries handled locally (cost: ~$0.002)
✅ 20-30% queries use cloud multiplex (cost: ~$0.025)
✅ Total cost reduction: 85-95% vs old $0.30 system
