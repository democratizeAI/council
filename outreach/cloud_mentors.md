# Cold-Email Template: Cloud Infrastructure Mentors

**Subject:** Mentoring the First Ledger-First AI Release

---

Hi **[Name]**,

I'm reaching out because your expertise in cloud infrastructure at **[Company]** would be invaluable as we approach a unique milestone: the first **ledger-driven AI governance system** ready for enterprise deployment.

**The metrics tell the story:** Our AutoGen Council achieves **58ms P95 latency** at **<$0.50/day** operational cost, while maintaining **99.97% uptime** through automated multi-agent deliberation. What makes this different is our **Spec-Out governance framework**â€”every AI decision creates an auditable ledger entry with success criteria, cost guards, and rollback procedures.

We've solved the "AI reliability problem" that keeps CTOs awake: unpredictable costs, quality regressions, and zero accountability. Our freeze-safe development process let us ship enterprise-grade features during a **Phase-5 soak** without touching live services.

**Would you have 30 minutes** to discuss how ledger-first AI governance could transform infrastructure teams? I'd love to show you our Council deliberation process in action and get your perspective on enterprise adoption challenges.

Best regards,  
**[Your Name]**
