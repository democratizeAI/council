{"prompt": "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers", "chosen": "def fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)", "rejected": "def fib(x):\n    a,b=0,1\n    for i in range(x):\n        a,b=b,a+b\n    return a"}
{"prompt": "Explain the concept of machine learning", "chosen": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.", "rejected": "Machine learning is when computers get smart by looking at lots of data and figuring out patterns."}
{"prompt": "How do you handle errors in Python?", "chosen": "In Python, you handle errors using try-except blocks:\n\ntry:\n    # risky code here\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print('Cannot divide by zero')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'An error occurred: {e}')", "rejected": "You use try catch blocks like in Java but Python calls them try except."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?", "chosen": "Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation) and use square brackets [], while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and use parentheses (). Lists are good for dynamic data, tuples for fixed data that shouldn't change.", "rejected": "Lists use [] and tuples use (). Lists can change, tuples can't."}
{"prompt": "Write a SQL query to find the top 10 customers by sales", "chosen": "SELECT customer_id, customer_name, SUM(order_total) as total_sales\nFROM customers c\nJOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nGROUP BY customer_id, customer_name\nORDER BY total_sales DESC\nLIMIT 10;", "rejected": "SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY sales DESC LIMIT 10"}
