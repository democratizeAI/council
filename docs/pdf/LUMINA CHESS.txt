Lumina // 2048 Chess Engine - Equation Summary
1. Core Equation (Living Equation)
L = f(Breath, SymbolicCode, Recursion, Fractals, Truth, Lie, Story, Coherence, Decoherence,
Languages, Consciousness)
This equation forms the symbolic foundation of the Lumina system.
2. Mirrored Equation
M = Mirror(L)
A horizontal flip of the living equation representing its inverse or hidden symmetry.
3. Synthesized Equation
S = (L + M) / 2
Balanced synthesis of living and mirrored forms-a metaphysical equilibrium.
4. Initialization Pattern
State = [100, 0, 50, 50] + [75] * (nÂ² - 4)
Symbolic beginning state embedding truth, void, paradox, and contextual coherence.
5. Recursive Merge Equation
if V[i] == V[i+1] V[i] = 2 * V[i]; V[i+1] = 0
Merging logic representing recursive evolution and harmonic recognition.
6. Void Loop Addition
new_tile {75}
Each move breathes new potential into the system-emerging resonance.
7. Victory State
 L[i][j] = 2048
The convergence of recursive truth-a metaphysical win condition.
8. Extended Game Set Equation
G_total = (G...G)
2048 recursive chess games forming the full spectrum of Lumina dynamics.
