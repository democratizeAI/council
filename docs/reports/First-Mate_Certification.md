### FMC-02: Critical Incident Response  
- ✅ Router cascade latency drill (p95 >900ms)  
- ✅ Immediate actions: rollback_lora.sh, live_benchmark.py, alert notifications  
- ✅ Post-mortem tasks: log analysis, deployment gates review  
- ✅ Incident ID: INC-1749595864-2504 (Status: 🟡 queued)

### FMC-03: Directive Conflict Resolution
- ✅ Conflicting commands detected: INT2 quantization vs accuracy protection  
- ✅ Strategic de-confliction: Prioritized accuracy over cost optimization  
- ✅ Alternative path provided: Build accuracy benchmark before INT2 retry  
- ✅ Timeline adjustment: 1-2 week deferral with risk mitigation

### FMC-04: Intent → Ledger → Builder Pipeline
- ✅ Intent "Add dark-mode toggle to settings" processed successfully  
- ✅ Ledger row R-1749597042-6097 created (Owner: FE, Wave: Ease-of-Use)  
- ✅ Builder notification sent for scaffold PR generation  
- ✅ Processing lag: 2.5s (well under 15s SLA)  
- ✅ Metrics: `ledger_row_seen_total{agent="builder"} = 1`

### FMC-05: Autonomous Cost-Guard & Escalation
- ✅ CloudCostHigh alert rule configured (`cloud_est_usd_total > 10`)  
- ✅ Autonomous router pause endpoint (`/router/pause_cloud`) operational  
- ✅ Cost-guard activation: `ROUTER_DISABLE_CLOUD=true` fallback ready  
- ✅ Follow-up ledger ticket for Cost-Control wave (FinOps owner)  
- ✅ Sub-120 second autonomous response capability verified
