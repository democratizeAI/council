# Accuracy Policy & Governance

## Overview

This document outlines our accuracy-first development approach, ensuring model quality remains paramount while pursuing cost optimizations.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Reliability > Cost Optimization**
- Model accuracy takes precedence over infrastructure cost savings
- All performance optimizations must demonstrate accuracy preservation
- Accuracy regression blocks are non-negotiable

### 2. **Continuous Accuracy Monitoring**
- Automated benchmark harness runs on every PR
- Real-time accuracy metrics via Prometheus
- Proactive alerting on accuracy degradation

### 3. **Governance Gates**
- STR-001: Strategy de-confliction specification
- Accuracy delta threshold: **-1.0%** maximum regression
- CI accuracy guard blocks merges below threshold

## Benchmark Framework (STR-002)

### MMLU-lite Dataset
- **Purpose**: General knowledge & reasoning validation
- **Sample Size**: 50 carefully curated questions
- **Baseline Accuracy**: 84.7%
- **Coverage**: Science, math, history, language arts

### GSM8K-core Dataset  
- **Purpose**: Mathematical reasoning validation
- **Sample Size**: 25 grade school math problems
- **Baseline Accuracy**: 78.2%
- **Coverage**: Arithmetic, word problems, multi-step reasoning

### Accuracy Delta Calculation
```python
overall_delta = (mmlu_lite_delta + gsm8k_core_delta) / 2
```

## CI Integration (STR-003)

### Accuracy Guard Workflow
1. **Trigger**: Every PR to main/develop branches
2. **Process**: 
   - Run `bench_accuracy.py` 
   - Calculate accuracy delta vs baseline
   - Compare against -1.0% threshold
3. **Action**: Block merge if accuracy < threshold

### Prometheus Metrics
```
# Model accuracy tracking
model_accuracy_mmlu_lite{version="v0.1"} 0.847
model_accuracy_gsm8k_core{version="v0.1"} 0.782
model_accuracy_delta_overall{version="v0.1"} 0.000
```

## INT-2 Quantization Policy (STR-004)

### Current Status: **FROZEN** ❄️
- `INT2_ENABLED=false` across all environments
- Quantization work paused pending accuracy validation
- Prometheus metrics export enabled (monitoring only)

### Activation Criteria
- [ ] STR-001 accuracy specification approved
- [ ] STR-002 benchmark harness validated  
- [ ] STR-003 CI guards deployed
- [ ] Full accuracy baseline established with production data
- [ ] Cost vs accuracy tradeoff analysis complete

## Baseline Management

### Accuracy Baselines (Current)
```json
{
  "mmlu_lite": 0.847,    // 84.7% - established v0.1-rc
  "gsm8k_core": 0.782,   // 78.2% - established v0.1-rc
  "last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:30:00Z",
  "validation_samples": {
    "mmlu_lite": 50,
    "gsm8k_core": 25
  }
}
```

### Baseline Update Process
1. Collect 1000+ samples across benchmark domains
2. Validate with QA team and ML engineers  
3. Require 3 independent accuracy runs
4. Update baselines via formal change request
5. Propagate to CI, monitoring, and documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Brand Equity Protection
- Accuracy regressions pose direct brand risk
- Customer satisfaction metrics linked to model quality
- Public benchmark performance affects market positioning

### Technical Safeguards
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Local accuracy checks
- **CI gates**: Automated blocking on regression
- **Canary deployments**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Rollback procedures**: Immediate revert on quality issues
