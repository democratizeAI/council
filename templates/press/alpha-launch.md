**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## Trinity Swarm Launches v0.1 Alpha: Enterprise AI Governance Meets Consumer Hardware

*Multi-agent orchestration platform delivers 76% latency improvement with automated quality assurance*

**[CITY, DATE]** - Trinity AI announces the alpha launch of Trinity Swarm v0.1, an enterprise-grade multi-agent AI orchestration platform that runs entirely on consumer hardware while maintaining corporate-level governance and security controls.

### Key Performance Achievements

Trinity Swarm v0.1 delivers significant performance improvements over previous generations:

- **76% Latency Improvement**: p95 response time reduced from 626ms to 150ms
- **69% Cost Reduction**: Daily operational costs decreased to $0.31 from ~$1.00
- **Enterprise Reliability**: 99.97% uptime with <90-second automated recovery
- **Local Privacy**: Zero customer data transmission to external cloud services

### Revolutionary Governance Framework

The platform introduces "Spec-Out" governance, which transforms vague project directives into measurable specifications with automated success criteria. This prevents computational waste and ensures every deployment meets predefined quality standards.

**Automated Quality Controls Include:**
- Accuracy guard preventing model degradation below 85% baseline
- Cost guard enforcing $3.33 daily spending limits
- LoRA Gauntlet validating fine-tuned model quality
- Guardian system providing real-time monitoring with automated rollback

### Enterprise-Grade Security on Consumer Hardware

Trinity Swarm achieves SOC2-ready compliance while running on standard gaming hardware:

**Security Features:**
- Complete audit trails with GPG-signed provenance tracking
- Sandboxed execution environment for AI-generated code
- Local-first architecture with zero cloud data dependency
- Automated incident response with 15-minute escalation SLA

### Technical Innovation

The platform leverages advanced multi-agent coordination through specialized "Council Heads":

- **Opus Strategist**: High-level planning and architectural decisions
- **Gemini Auditor**: Compliance validation and security oversight  
- **Sonnet Builder**: Code generation and implementation
- **Router Cascade**: Request coordination and response integration

Supporting service agents handle automation, intent processing, and quality assurance through the platform's distributed Redis-based coordination system.

### Alpha Program Details

The Trinity Swarm v0.1 Alpha is available immediately for qualified enterprise partners and AI researchers. The program includes:

- Complete docker-compose deployment stack
- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- 24/7 automated health monitoring
- Access to certification pipeline tools
- Developer documentation and best practices guide
