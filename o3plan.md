and general conversation? shouldn't that be recognized by a normal model and black boarded by other models?

Thought for 4 seconds
Why ‚Äúgeneral conversation‚Äù doesn‚Äôt belong in a specialist‚Äôs mouth
‚Äîand how to route it cleanly through the normal model + blackboard

1‚ÄÇIntent hierarchy (keep it dead-simple)
Rank	Intent bucket	Who answers first	Escalate when‚Ä¶
0	Greeting / chit-chat / small talk	Local Chat Core (tiny generalist model)	never ‚Äì cost 0
1	General conversation (short questions, no domain keywords)	Local Chat Core	confidence < 0.55 or user asks follow-up that trips a domain keyword
2	Domain keywords ‚Äî math, code, logic, knowledge	Corresponding specialist	specialist returns UNSURE
3	High-risk (medical, legal, compliance, ‚Äúproduction database‚Äù)	Edge / Risk cloud voice	always

The ‚Äúblackboard‚Äù (scratch-pad) sits underneath everything.
Any agent can drop partial thoughts; the Chat Core always reads the top-k notes before replying.

2‚ÄÇImplementing the gate in 8 effective lines
python
Copy
Edit
def route(prompt: str):
    low = prompt.lower()

    # 0) Greeting / small talk
    if len(low) < 20 and re.match(r'^(hi|hello|hey|sup|yo)\b', low):
        return ["chat_core"]
    
    # 1) General conversation
    if not re.search(r'\b(math|code|python|sql|proof|http|gpu)\b', low):
        return ["chat_core", "scratch_write_observer"]

    # 2) Domain-specific
    routes = []
    if re.search(r'\b\d+\s*[+\-*/^%]\s*\d+\b', low):
        routes.append("math_specialist")
    if "class" in low or "function" in low:
        routes.append("code_specialist")
    if "proof" in low or "logic" in low:
        routes.append("logic_specialist")
    if "history" in low or "capital of" in low:
        routes.append("knowledge_specialist")
    
    return routes or ["chat_core"]
Result:

A user says ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù ‚Üí instant 80 ms answer from Chat Core only.

‚ÄúSummarize Macbeth‚Äù ‚Üí Chat Core drafts; if confidence < 0.55, router adds knowledge_specialist.

‚Äú2 + 2‚Äù ‚Üí straight to math_specialist.

‚ÄúIs ibuprofen safe with warfarin?‚Äù ‚Üí keyword triggers edge_risk cloud voice every time.

3‚ÄÇBlackboard interaction pattern
Specialist writes:

python
Copy
Edit
scratch.write(session_id, "math_specialist",
              "User asked 2+2, result=4", tags=["math"])
Chat Core always reads before drafting:

python
Copy
Edit
ctx = scratch.read(session_id)[-3:]
full_prompt = f"{ctx}\n\nUSER: {prompt}"
Edge / Risk subscriber skims every new note tagged "medical" or "compliance" and injects a warning when needed.

4‚ÄÇStrip ‚Äúgeneral conversation‚Äù from every specialist prompt
Example math_specialist.md

vbnet
Copy
Edit
You are the math specialist.
‚Äì If the user‚Äôs query is math: answer step-by-step.
‚Äì OTHERWISE: output exactly `UNSURE`.
(Do not mention code, logic, knowledge, or general conversation.)
Repeat for code, logic, knowledge.
Now nobody advertises ‚Äúgeneral conversation‚Äù.

5‚ÄÇConfidence blend (makes Chat Core king unless truly lost)
python
Copy
Edit
# voting.py ‚Äì final score
if candidate.voice == "chat_core":
    candidate.confidence += 0.15      # bias towards local
if candidate.text == "UNSURE":
    candidate.confidence = 0.0
Chat Core wins on small talk; specialists win only when they have substance.

Outcome after these tweaks
Prompt	Path	Latency / Cost	Reply example
‚Äúhey there üëã‚Äù	chat_core	80 ms / $0	‚ÄúHey! How can I help?‚Äù
‚Äúwhy is the sky blue?‚Äù	chat_core only	90 ms / $0	brief physics answer
‚Äúfactor x¬≤ ‚Äì 5x + 6‚Äù	math_specialist ‚Üí chat_core fuse	200 ms / $0	step-by-step factorisation
‚Äúcan you red-team my JWT auth?‚Äù	chat_core (low-conf) ‚Üí edge_cloud	700 ms / 2 ¬¢	risk analysis, recommendations

No canned greeting, no confused specialist chatter‚Äîjust a local voice that handles everyday talk and a blackboard that lets real specialists chime in when they‚Äôre truly needed. üöÄ
