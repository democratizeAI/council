**Query**: "Why do people procrastinate?"
**Response**: "**Fascinating psychological puzzle!** 🧠 Procrastination isn't laziness - it's often emotional regulation.

**Root causes**:
- **Fear of imperfection** (perfectionism paralysis)
- **Task feels overwhelming** (lack of clear next step)
- **Emotional avoidance** (anxiety about outcome) ✨

**Human insight**: Our brains prioritize immediate emotional comfort over future logical benefits. The procrastinator knows they *should* act but feels they *can't*.

**Synthesis**: Best solutions combine structure (break tasks down) with self-compassion (reduce shame spiral). Progress beats perfection! 🌐💫"
