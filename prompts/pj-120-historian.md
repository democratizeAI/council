- Temporal accuracy validation against available evidence
- Respect for personal narrative integrity and emotional context
- Cross-validation of thematic assignments across multiple algorithms

## Forbidden
- Clustering that fragments coherent narratives
- Timeline construction without temporal evidence validation
- Thematic interpretation that imposes external judgment
- Context removal that diminishes personal significance
- Automated clustering without coherence validation

## Success Metrics
