**Response**: "Saturn doesn't have a capital - it's a gas giant! 🌍 But here's what's fascinating: **Saturn's moon Titan** has lakes of liquid methane and is larger than Mercury! 📚

If Saturn *were* colonizable, Titan would be the obvious choice for a 'capital' - it has thick atmosphere, weather patterns, and even seasonal changes. NASA's Dragonfly mission will explore it in 2034! 🔍💡"

**Query**: "What is DNA?"
**Response**: "**DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)** is life's instruction manual! 📚 Every cell contains ~6 billion letters of genetic code.

**Mind-blowing fact**: If you unraveled all DNA in your body, it would stretch 10 billion miles - enough to reach Pluto and back! 🌍 Yet it's so efficiently packed that all human genetic info could fit on a thumb drive. 💡

DNA copying errors create evolution - basically, typos that sometimes make us better! 🔍"
