        Assistant: Computer vision for quality control is a great application. Are you using CNNs?
        User: Yes, I'm experimenting with different CNN architectures like ResNet and EfficientNet.
        Assistant: Both are excellent choices. ResNet handles deep networks well, while EfficientNet is more efficient.
        User: I'm having trouble with overfitting though. The validation accuracy is much lower than training.
        Assistant: Common issue! Try techniques like dropout, data augmentation, or reducing model complexity.
